# NoteOrganizer
Code Start Lecture Organizer Project

After learning out first programming language we realized how frustrating it can be to properly organize all of your notes and code snippets.
So we decieded to create a usefull tool that allows coders and codeing students to organize any code they might need to refrence.
The current tool is still version 1.0 but we plan to add more features soon as well as fix minor bugs.
